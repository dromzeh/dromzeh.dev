I recently rewrote my site to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Where it's being hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) using [next-on-pages](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/).

For the most part, next-on-pages works incredibly well. However, if you're new to deploying Next.js sites on Cloudflare Pages, it can get tedious.

This article is how I added posts to my Next.js site hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

## Markdown on Next.js

The first part is to add support for Markdown files in Next.js. For this, I used `next-mdx-remote`. It's a library that allows you to render MDX files as React components.

For this, I first created a declaration file called `mdx.d.ts` in the root of my project:

```ts
declare module "*.mdx" {
    let MDXComponent: (props) => JSX.Element;
    export default MDXComponent;
}
```

Then, it was onto reconfiguring my `next.config.js` to output the site as a static site:

```ts
const nextConfig = {
    /// ....
    output: "export",
};
```

Now, we need to create a way to fetch posts. In this case, we can create a `fetch-posts.ts` lib file which contains:

- A way to fetch all posts
- A way to fetch a single post

To fetch all posts, we can simply use `fs` to read the `posts` directory and filter out the `.mdx` files:

If our post is not published, we can simply return `null`:

```ts
import matter from "gray-matter";
import fs from "fs/promises";
import path from "path";
import type { Post } from "../types";

export const getPosts = async () => {
    const posts = await fs.readdir("./src/posts/");

    return Promise.all(
        posts
            .filter((file) => path.extname(file) === ".mdx")
            .map(async (file) => {
                const filePath = `./src/posts/${file}`;

                const postContent = await fs.readFile(filePath, "utf8");

                const { data, content } = matter(postContent);

                if (data.published === false) {
                    return null;
                }

                return {
                    title: data.title,
                    slug: data.slug,
                    date: data.date,
                    description: data.description,
                    views: data.views || null,
                    body: content,
                } as Post;
            }),
    );
};
```

To fetch a single post, we can use the `getPosts` function and filter out the post by the slug:

```ts
export async function getPost(slug: string) {
    const posts = await getPosts();
    return posts.find((post) => post?.slug === slug);
}
```

## Rendering Posts

Now that we have a way to fetch posts, we can render them using `next-mdx-remote`. 

I created a `markdown-component.tsx` file that contains the components for rendering the markdown.

For example, to render a `strong` tag, I created a `Strong` component then added it to the exported `mdxComponents` object:

```tsx
function Strong(
    props: React.DetailedHTMLProps<
        React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>,
        HTMLElement
    >,
) {
    const { children, ...rest } = props;
    return (
        <b {...rest} className="text-foreground font-semibold">
            {children}
        </b>
    );
}


export const mdxComponents: MDXComponents = {
    strong: Strong,
};
```

Then, I created a `post-body.tsx` file that contains the `PostBody` component, this component uses `MDXRemote` to render the markdown:

```tsx
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote/rsc";

import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm";
import rehypeSlug from "rehype-slug";
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from "rehype-autolink-headings";
import remarkA11yEmoji from "@fec/remark-a11y-emoji";
import remarkToc from "remark-toc";
import { mdxComponents } from "./markdown-component";

export function PostBody({ children }: { children: string }) {
    return (
        <MDXRemote
            source={children}
            options={{
                mdxOptions: {
                    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm, remarkA11yEmoji, remarkToc],
                    rehypePlugins: [rehypeSlug, rehypeAutolinkHeadings],
                },
            }}
            components={mdxComponents}
        />
    );
}
```

For the basic configuration, that's all you need to render posts in Next.js, where you pass the `body` of the post to the `PostBody` component.

For our `posts/[id]` route, we use `generateStaticParams` to generate the routes for each post, as we can't edge render this.

```ts
export async function generateStaticParams() {
    const posts = await getPosts();

    return posts.map((post) => ({
        id: post!.slug,
    }));
}
```

For generating metadata, we can use `generateMetadata` function.

```ts
export async function generateMetadata({ params }: Props): Promise<Metadata> {
    const { id } = params;
    const post = await getPost(id);

    if (!post) return notFound();

    return {
        title: `${post.title} â€¢ dromzeh.dev`,
        description: post.description,
        metadataBase: new URL("https://dromzeh.dev"),
    };
}
```

Then in the PostPage, we can fetch the post and render it.

```tsx
export default async function PostPage({ params: { id } }: Props) {
    const post = await getPost(id);

    if (!post) return notFound();

    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen max-w-xl mx-auto flex items-center justify-center">
                <section className="flex flex-col space-y-4 mt-8 max-w-xl">
                    <PostBody>{post.body}</PostBody>
                </section>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Conclusion

You can freely use this to build onto this to add additional entries such as tags.

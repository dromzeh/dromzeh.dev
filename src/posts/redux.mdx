While working on mass downloading for [wanderer.moe](https://wanderer.moe), I wanted to implement a feature that would allow users to select multiple assets and download them in a single click. 

To enhance the user experience further, I also wanted to synchronize the selected assets and download state across multiple browser tabs in real-time.

This article details my approach to implementing this feature using Next.js, Redux, Redux Persist, and Redux State Sync.

## The Challenge I Faced

My goal was to create a system that could:

1. Share state across the entire application
2. Persist state through page refreshes and tab closures
3. Synchronize state in real-time across multiple browser tabs

I quickly realized that while React's Context API can handle cross-component state sharing, it falls short for persistence and cross-tab synchronization.

## My Solution: Redux, Redux Persist, and Redux State Sync

To address these challenges, I implemented state management with Redux Persist and Redux State Sync. Here's how I approached it:

### Storage Implementation

First, I created a hybrid storage solution to accommodate both client-side and server-side rendering:

```typescript
import createWebStorage from "redux-persist/es/storage/createWebStorage";

const createNoopStorage = () => {
    return {
        getItem() {
            return Promise.resolve(null);
        },
        setItem(_key: string, value: number) {
            return Promise.resolve(value);
        },
        removeItem() {
            return Promise.resolve();
        },
    };
};

export const storage =
    typeof window !== "undefined"
        ? createWebStorage("local")
        : createNoopStorage();
```

This storage configuration ensures that my application can run on both the client and server without issues.

### Redux State Structure

I designed the Redux state to encapsulate the essential data for cross-tab synchronization. In this case, we only need to manage:

- **isMassDownloading**: A boolean flag to indicate if mass downloading, to compare against the local state for the download indicator.
- **selectedAssets**: An array of the selected assets.

```typescript
import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import type { Asset } from "~/lib/types";

export interface IAssetState {
    isMassDownloading: boolean;
    selectedAssets: Asset[];
}

const initialState: IAssetState = {
    isMassDownloading: false,
    selectedAssets: [],
};
```

### Redux Slice Implementation

I then implemented the `assetSlice` with appropriate actions and reducers:

```typescript
export const assetSlice = createSlice({
    name: "assets",
    initialState,
    reducers: {
        setSelectedAssets: (state, action: PayloadAction<Asset[]>) => {
            state.selectedAssets = action.payload || [];
        },
        setIsMassDownloading: (state, action: PayloadAction<boolean>) => {
            state.isMassDownloading = action.payload || false;
        },
        toggleAssetSelection: (state, action: PayloadAction<Asset>) => {
            if (state.isMassDownloading) return;

            const index = state.selectedAssets.findIndex(
                (asset) => asset.path === action.payload.path,
            );
            if (index >= 0) {
                state.selectedAssets.splice(index, 1);
            } else {
                state.selectedAssets.push(action.payload);
            }
        },
        clearSelectedAssets: (state) => {
            state.selectedAssets = [];
        },
    },
});
```

### Redux Configuration


I setup the Redux configuration with the `persistReducer` and `combineReducers` functions to persist the state across sessions:

```typescript
import { combineReducers } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { persistReducer } from "redux-persist";
import { storage } from "./storage";
import assetSlice from "./slice/asset-slice";

export const persistConfig = {
    key: "root",
    storage: storage,
    whitelist: ["assets"],
};

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    assets: assetSlice,
});

export const persistedReducer = persistReducer(persistConfig, rootReducer);
```

Then, I configured the Redux store with the `createStateSyncMiddleware` and `initMessageListener` to synchronize the state across tabs:

```typescript
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { persistedReducer } from "./reducer";
import {
    createStateSyncMiddleware,
    initMessageListener,
} from "redux-state-sync";
import {
    useDispatch,
    TypedUseSelectorHook,
    useSelector,
    useStore,
} from "react-redux";
import logger from "redux-logger";
import { persistStore } from "redux-persist";

const blacklist = ["persist/PERSIST", "persist/REHYDRATE"];

export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: persistedReducer,
    middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
        getDefaultMiddleware().prepend(
            logger,
            createStateSyncMiddleware({
                predicate: (action) => {
                    if (typeof action !== "function") {
                        if (Array.isArray(blacklist)) {
                            return blacklist.indexOf(action.type) < 0;
                        }
                    }
                    return false;
                },
            }),
        ) as any, // typescript complains
});

export const persistor = persistStore(store);

initMessageListener(store);
```

Certain actions are also blacklisted to ensure compatibility.

### Redux Provider

Finally, we import `Provider` and `PersistGate` from `react-redux` and `redux-persist/integration/react` to wrap the application with the Redux provider:

```tsx
"use client";

import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { PersistGate } from "redux-persist/integration/react";
import { store, persistor } from "./store";

export const ReduxProvider = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
    return (
        <Provider store={store}>
            <PersistGate loading={null} persistor={persistor}>
                {children}
            </PersistGate>
        </Provider>
    );
};

export default ReduxProvider;
```

## Component Integration

With the custom hooks I created, I can call this into any component as long as it is wrapped in the Redux provider. Here's how I implemented features for the `asset-item.tsx` component:

```tsx
import { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from "~/redux/store";

const dispatch = useAppDispatch();

const isSelected = isAssetSelected(
    useAppSelector((state) => state.assets),
    asset,
);
```

With the above, you can access the Redux state and dispatch actions directly from the component.

```ts
<button onClick={() => dispatch(toggleAssetSelection(asset))}>
    {isSelected ? "Deselect" : "Select"}
</button>
```

### Download Indicator

I created a local context to manage the download indicator state, where I can compare the local state with the global state to determine what should be conditionally rendered:

```tsx
const {
    isUnsharedMassDownloading,
    setIsUnsharedMassDownloading,
    isIndicatorOpen,
} = useContext(AssetDownloadIndicatorContext);

const isMassDownloading = useAppSelector(
    (state) => state.assets.isMassDownloading,
);


{isUnsharedMassDownloading && <ShowMassDownloadProgress />}

{isMassDownloading && !isUnsharedMassDownloading && (
    <MassDownloadInProgress />
)}
```

## Conclusion

While implementing cross-tab state synchronization may seem complex, it significantly enhances user experience in multi-tab scenarios. 

In my case, this solution not only improved user engagement but also increased the probability of users revisiting the site.

Every time you share anything online, you're feeding the machine, something that will eventually replace you.

Think about it for a second. You spend your own time writing that post, editing that video, sharing something you're proud of. You're trying to connect with people & share something meaningful to you with the world online.

In reality? You just unwillingly contributed to the machine.

## Silent Theft

Everything you share gets scraped, videos get analyzed, photos get processed. Every word, every frame, every interaction becomes nothing but data. And that data is what teaches machines to replicate you.

This behaviour is often excused as being "publicly available" so it's "okay". As if making something public actually now means giving up your right to it. As if sharing your thoughts is the same as just completely surrendering them.

## Algorithms Don't Care About You

Social platforms with stupid algorithms have convinced you that you need them. That without their reach, your thoughts don't matter. That engagement you get equals validation which equals relevance, you feel like you're worth something.

But the algorithm doesn't care about what you're trying to say. It cares about the retention, time spent, clicks generated, etc.

You're not a person on these platforms, just another statistic.

## The Machine

Remember when all you heard about AI was generated 4chan greentext?  When generated images were almost comedic?

Now, it's at a stage where people are getting fooled by it.

Your way of expressing yourself, your thoughts, your personality - all of it scraped, processed, and regurgitated without your consent.

When the machine can generate your content, or even your voice, you're losing yourself and what makes you, you.

The machine is reducing you to nothing. Your personality, the growth, the connection you gain - none of that matters to it.

## You aren't entirely helpless

You don't need social platforms as much as they need you.

They're nothing without users. LLMs are nothing without training data. The machine only works because we keep feeding it.

Every platform that claims to "connect people" is really just isolating them, controlling them & monetizing them.

But you still own your thoughts. You still choose where and who you want to share them with.

You can keep posting to platforms that see your thoughts as training data. You can keep building your audience on land that isn't yours. 

You can keep hoping, refreshing, and praying the algorithm will favour you today to feel a sense of worth the machine has got you addicted to.

Alternatively, stop feeding the machine.

Your thoughts have value. Your expression deserves platforms that respect it, not ones that exploit it.

The machine broke what makes us human, but it doesn't have to stay broken.

Stop feeding the machine. Start protecting your voice. Learn to share on your own terms.

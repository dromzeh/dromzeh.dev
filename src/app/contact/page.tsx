                                If you're under 16 and have discovered a bug or
                                issue with any of my projects, I still want to
                                help! You can either email me with your
                                findings, or join Originoid's discord at{" "}

                                When you reach out, a little context goes a long
                                way. I truly appreciate messages that are clear,
                                thoughtful, and give me a sense of what you're
                                hoping to discuss. The more details you can
                                share, the better I can understand and help you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being transparent, I receive quite a few
                                messages, which means my responses might not be
                                instantaneous. Please know this isn't personal â€”
                                I read and value every message and normally
                                reply within 24 hours. If you don't hear back
                                after a while, a gentle nudge is always welcome.
                            </p>
